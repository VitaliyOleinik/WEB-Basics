							Hurricane Dorian devastation leaves 'surreal landscape' in Bahamas
						</h1>
						<p>
							The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be "staggering", the country's government has warned as aid efforts are being stepped up.

							Officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, the worst-hit part of the archipelago.

							The storm, which has now weakened, is moving slowly north along the eastern US seaboard.

							Ferrari's Charles Leclerc ended an incident-strewn, wet-dry first practice fastest at the Italian Grand Prix.
						</h1>
						<p>
							Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen and Racing Point's Sergio Perez crashed in the wet conditions early on, before the drivers switched to dry-weather slicks late on.

Leclerc, fresh from his maiden victory in Belgium, was 0.306 seconds quicker than the McLaren's Carlos Sainz.

Sainz's team-mate Lando Norris was third ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton.

The world champion was held up in the fastest part of the session at the end by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. The German was clearly slower than Hamilton but would not let him by.

							Robert Mugabe: From liberator to tyrant
						</h1>
						<p>
							To others, he was a revolutionary hero, who fought racial oppression and stood up to Western imperialism and neo-colonialism.

On his own terms, he was an undoubted success.

First, he delivered independence for Zimbabwe after decades of white-minority rule.

He then remained in power for 37 years - outlasting his greatest enemies and rivals such as Tony Blair, George W Bush, Joshua Nkomo, Morgan Tsvangirai and Nelson Mandela.
